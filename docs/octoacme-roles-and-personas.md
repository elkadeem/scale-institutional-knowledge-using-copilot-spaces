## How these personas are used in the exercise
- Use these persona definitions to frame scenarios and sample interactions in the Skills Exercise.
- Each persona can be used as a persona prompt for Copilot Spaces to shape role-specific guidance.
- The expanded set of personas — including **DevOps Engineer**, **UX/UI Designer**, and **Data Analyst** — enables more realistic cross-functional scenarios covering operations, design, and data-driven decision-making.
