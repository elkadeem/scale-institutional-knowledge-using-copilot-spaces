# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation hub. This README provides a brief overview of how OctoAcme runs projects and links to all process documents in this folder.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative project management methodology designed to deliver customer value efficiently while maintaining transparency across teams and stakeholders.

### Core Principles

- **Customer-first thinking**: prioritize customer value and usability in every decision.
- **Iterative delivery**: ship small, testable increments to reduce risk and gather feedback early.
- **Clear ownership**: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead responsible for delivery.
- **Data-informed decision-making**: measure impact and iterate based on evidence, not assumptions.
- **Psychological safety**: encourage open feedback, learning from failures, and continuous improvement.

### Key Lifecycle Phases

1. **Project Initiation** — validate the business need, align stakeholders, define success metrics, and decide go/no-go.
2. **Planning** — define scope, resources, milestones, dependencies, and the sprint/iteration backlog.
3. **Execution & Tracking** — build, test, review, and iterate; track progress against plan and surface blockers early.
4. **Risk Management & Communication** — maintain a risk register, escalate issues promptly, and keep stakeholders informed.
5. **Release & Deployment** — deploy, verify, and announce; follow the release checklist and rollback plan.
6. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** — capture learnings, celebrate wins, and drive actionable improvements.

### Core Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Project Manager (PM)** | Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communications. |
| **Product Manager (PdM)** | Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success. |
| **Developers** | Implement features, collaborate on design and testability. |
| **QA/Testing** | Validate quality and acceptance criteria. |
| **Stakeholders** | Provide inputs and approvals. |

### Key Artifacts

- **Project Charter / One-pager** — problem statement, goals, success metrics, and high-level timeline.
- **Roadmap and Release Plan** — planned milestones and feature releases.
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog** — prioritized list of work for each delivery cycle.
- **Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done** — shared agreement on what "complete" means.
- **Risk Register** — tracked risks, owners, likelihood, and mitigations.
- **Retrospective Notes** — learnings and action items from each iteration or release.

### Communication Cadence

- **Daily/Twice-weekly standups** — delivery team syncs on progress and blockers.
- **Weekly sync** — PM and PdM alignment on priorities and status.
- **Monthly stakeholder updates** — broader audience briefing on progress and risks.
- **Ad-hoc escalations** — as needed for blockers or critical risks.
